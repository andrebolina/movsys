# Movsys

### App developed by [André Bolina](https://bolina.dev)

#### Scenario

Using the [OMDb API] (http://www.omdbapi.com/) (The Open Movie Database) develop two screens (don't stick too much to the design, you can choose Material to simplify things) with the following functions:

- [x] Movie search screen with:
  - [x] Movie search filter by Name (mandatory) and Year (optional);
  - [x] List with the first 10 movies returned in the search (pagination is not necessary).
  - [x] The list must have the poster of movie, the title and the average of all its ratings;
  - [x] Function to order the result by alphabetical order (increasing or decreasing) or average grade (increasing or decreasing);
- [x] Screen with detailed information of the movie (must be accessed by clicking on a movie in the search screen);

#### Requirements

- [x] Must be developed in React;
- [x] Redux must be used to manage the state of the application;

#### Suggestions

- [x] We suggest use CRA (Create React App).

#### What will be evaluated

- Ability to adapt to new APIs;
- Unit tests (Jest);
- Project structure;
- Domain of used technologies;
- Domain of Git
